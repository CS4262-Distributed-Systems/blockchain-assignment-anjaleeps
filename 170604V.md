1. Got to know about the use of smart contracts in blockchain systems to control the logic and rules related to asset transactions. Smart contracts provide an easy-to-use access point to create, query, and update assets for members who are members of the channel the contract is deployed on. The basic smart contract used in this example provides the basic rules for creating, updating, reading, and deleting assets stored on the ledger.

2. Understood the basics of using Hyperledger Fabric to create blockchain applications. For example, how the ledgers are maintained by peers and updated under the rules defined by smart contracts, and uses a separate orderer to maintain the consistency of transactions through mechanisms like packaging transaction proposals and consensus management.
